            <h3> Context </h3>
          <p> The origins of Arts and Crafts go as far back as the 1860s in the United Kingdom. This was known as the arts and crafts movement, this movement involved decorative and fine arts and would eventually spread through the British Empire. There were three significant characteristics in the Arts & Crafts movement which includes natural qualities, designs, motifs inspired by nature, and “Vernacular designs” that focus on traditional techniques.

                  <h3> My innovation </h3>
                      <p> My idea is to have a droid, called RR30, that shows the user how to do arts and crafts. RR30 can provide creative prompts to give the user if they’re struggling to come up with an idea, the droid can also make art based on the descriptions the user provides which can be inspirational for its user.  RR30 can be shaped to the users liking big or small, and more. Apart from this, RR30 also comes with tutorials so the user can learn new art styles and new crafts such as origami.  Since it’s a droid, it also comes with a hologram that allows users to make artwork and freely express themselves.  R30 saves all the progress and sends it to the cloud automatically in case anything goes wrong. You can also take work you’ve made on paper and input it into RR30 that way you can save things more efficiently.
